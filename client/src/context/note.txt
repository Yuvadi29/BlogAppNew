Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible to many components at different nesting levels. Rather than passing redundant props we use Context api instead.

React.createContext() will create a context object. When the component subscribing to this object is rendered, it will read the current context value mentioned.

Context.Provider() is used to accept a value prop that is to be passed to consuming components that are the children of the provider.  Every context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.
